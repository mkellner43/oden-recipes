The Oden Project--

In this project I have created a Etch-A-Sketch!

I used JS to manipulate the DOM in this project. By using different event listeners I was able to create patterns in my grid by changing the background color of each "box" that I created by using a for loop. I was able to have a user manipulate the grid size while maintaining the overall size of the grid (making each "box" smaller) by again using JS to manipulate the DOM and greate a grid system that repeats each item evenly.
This was a super fun project because I was able to test my knowledge of JS and how to really make things I wanted to work, work! For example I wanted to be able to reset the page but store the users value (if they did adjust the grid size). I did that by using simple if else logic. I created defaults on load of the page and a maximum grid size of 100. If the user enters something that is not between my expected values, the grid will default to a grid size of 16.
